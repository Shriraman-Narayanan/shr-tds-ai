npm install -g promptfoo

# Run evaluation (after updating the URL in promptfooconfig.yaml)
promptfoo eval

# View results
promptfoo view
```

## üìù How to Use the Agent

1. **Create a questions file**: Make a `.txt` file with questions (one per line)
   ```
   What patterns do you see in this dataset?
   How can I improve data quality?
   What statistical tests should I run?
   ```

2. **Prepare your dataset** (optional): Upload CSV, JSON, or Excel files

3. **Upload and analyze**: Use the web interface to get AI-powered insights

## üîß Features

- **File Upload Support**: Questions (.txt) and datasets (.csv, .json, .xlsx)
